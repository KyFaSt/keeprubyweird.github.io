    markdown:
      Keep Ruby Weird aims to bring back some of the wonder and playfulness of Ruby,
      while also capitalizing on Austin's own "weirdness" culture to make a really fun
      and interesting conference. We want to make sure that the Austin and Ruby
      communities really benefit from this. That's why we're endeavoring to work with
      local companies whenever possible. We're also setting aside a portion of the
      tickets as a scholarship program. We don't want the reason that someone doesn't
      come to the event to be price.

      Keep Ruby Weird will take place at the Alamo Drafthouse at the Ritz, a local
      movie theater renowned for its great moviegoing experience. Alamo Drafthouse is
      always one of the first places Austinites direct newcomers to check out, and
      we're all really excited to get to show it off as part of the conference. The
      capacity of the Drafthouse's theaters is 179 people, so that's the number we're
      shooting for for attendees, speakers, and staff.

      We're also committed to providing a safe and harassment free environment. See
      our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) for more information.

      Keep Ruby Weird can't happen without help from sponsors. We have a few different
      sponsorship levels, and of course we're open to other arrangements.
