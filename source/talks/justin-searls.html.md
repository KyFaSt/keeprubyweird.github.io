  "abstract": "Most programmers acknowledge programming is a creative endeavor, but few identify themselves as "creative types."\n\nPopular conceptions of creativity focus on passion, art, and vision—setting a pretty high bar. My creativity has a humbler source: the toxic negative emotions already dwelling inside me.\n\nIn this talk, I'll share 9 projects I used to practice emotionally honest creativity and how each helped me mitigate my feelings of incompetence, inadequacy, and indignation as a software developer.\n\nDemystifying creativity can change the trajectory of your career & this talk will show you how.",
  "bio": "Nobody knows bad code like Justin Searls. Relative to his peers, he is able to produce bad code effortlessly. He spends so much time with bad code, that he’s got a lot of experience thinking and talking about some of the reasons the industry has gotten so good at producing bad software. In 2011, Justin and Todd Kaufman founded [Test Double](http://testdouble.com), an agency dedicated to identifying what’s broken about software and what we can collectively do to fix it."
