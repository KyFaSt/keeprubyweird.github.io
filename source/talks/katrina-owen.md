  "abstract": "As novices we slowly and laboriously sift through a chaotic flood of minutia. To experts the significant details are obvious. The novice receives a jumble of impressions; the expert sees patterns and meaning.\n\nScience knows how to speed us from \"How could you possibly tell?\" to \"How could you not?\".",
  "bio": "Katrina is an open source advocate at GitHub. She accidentally became a developer while pursuing a degree in molecular biology. When programming, her focus is on automation, workflow optimization, and refactoring. She works primarily in Go and Ruby, contributes to several open source projects, and is the creator of exercism.io."
