    "abstract": "Catching software bugs is a mysterious magic, unknowable by science and untouchable by process.\n\nFalse! Programming bugs, like real bugs, can be organized into a taxonomy. Come with me and I'll show you how classification can help you build “programmer’s instinct” into a logical debugging process.",
    "bio": "Kylie is a Web Developer at MailChimp in Atlanta, GA and Co-Organizer of Rails Girls ATL. Untrained in computer science, she first taught herself Visual Basic as a survival tactic and then Ruby on Rails in an attempt to switch careers. Once learning Ruby on Rails through community support, she has been dedicated to creating those same opportunities for others."
