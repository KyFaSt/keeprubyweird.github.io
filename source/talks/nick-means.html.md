    "abstract": "In the summer of 1978, structural engineer William LeMessurier got a phone call that terrified him. An undergraduate student claimed that LeMessurier's acclaimed 59-story Citicorp Center in Manhattan, just completed the year prior, was dangerously unstable under certain wind conditions. The student was right, and it was almost hurricane season.\n\nInnovation always brings risk of significant mistakes because you're venturing into the unknown. The key to building a culture of innovation in your team is learning how to respond when those mistakes happen. Let's let Bill LeMessurier teach us how to respond when it all goes wrong so that our creations can thrive despite our mistakes.",
